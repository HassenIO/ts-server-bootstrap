# Typescript + ExpressJS Server Boilerplate for Backend API

This is a boilerplate backend API server written in Typescript and using ExpressJS web framework.

## Getting started

First install necessary dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, copy or rename `example.env` into `.env` and set the needed environment variables if necessary.

Compile Typescript into Javascript using `npm run build:dev`. This will compile Typescript and wait for changes to trigger a new compilation.

To compile without watching, consider running `npm run build:prod`.

To start the server, run `npm start`. Server will automatically restart after each build.

## Testing

Run `npm test` to test with jest.

## Collaboration

Every suggestion is welcome.
